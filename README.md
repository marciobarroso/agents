# AI Agents Collection for Claude Code

A comprehensive collection of specialized AI agents designed to work with Claude Code, providing expert assistance across engineering, design, marketing, security, testing, and project management domains. Each agent is optimized for specific tasks and can be used as sub-agents within Claude Code's agent system.

> **Inspired by [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD)** - This agent collection draws inspiration from the Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development (BMAD), which pioneered the concept of specialized AI agents collaborating in rapid development cycles. BMAD's innovative approach to agentic planning and context-engineered development has influenced the design philosophy and rapid development focus of these agents.

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites: Install Claude Code

First, install Claude Code if you haven't already:

```bash
# Install Claude Code
curl -fsSL https://claude-code.anthropic.com/install.sh | sh

# Or using npm
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
```

### Download and Install Agents

Download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marciobarroso/agents.git
```

Copy to your Claude Code agents directory:

```bash
cp -r agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
```

Or manually copy all the agent files to your `~/.claude/agents/` directory.

Restart Claude Code to load the new agents.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Agents are automatically available in Claude Code. Simply describe your task and the appropriate agent will be triggered. You can also explicitly request an agent by mentioning their name.

## üìã Overview

This project defines 40+ specialized agents that can be integrated with Claude Code to provide expert-level assistance in various domains. Each agent is designed with specific expertise, tools, and responsibilities to handle different aspects of software development and business operations within rapid development cycles (typically 6-day sprints). The collection includes 2 bonus agents for team morale and performance coaching.
